Optical Camera Communication (OCC) 

Our target is creating a robust framework for transmitting information from a simple blinking LED and recieving by camera.

Potential Applications:
Diagnostics of low cost electronical devices. (Cellphone)
Providing traffic information to a car. (DashCam)
Simplified authentication of smart devices to home network.

This repo consists followings:
* Microcontroller part that modulates LED.
* Camera part that makes image processing and demodulating the recievied signal.
